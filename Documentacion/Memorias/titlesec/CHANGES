====================

History of v2.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1998/08/05 to
1998/08/29  Fully reimplemented

History of v2.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1999/01/05  We define in this file the three basic shapes.
            Additional ones remain defined in external files.
            Unified the shapes for sections and chapters.
1999/01/05  \ttl@shape merged into \ttl@format@iii.
1999/01/05  \titlerule
1999/01/07  \ttl@defkeys splitted from \ttl@keys
1999/01/10  Added the \part stuff, including a definition of \@openright
1999/01/11  Removed unnecessary \ttl@numsecfalse in \ttl@sect@i.
1999/01/14  Optimized \titlerule
1999/01/27  Changed \titleline to correct the spacing at the
            top page and to fix a bug which changed the mode
            to horizontal, thus introducing unwanted space
            (\makebox -> \@makebox).
1999/02/02  \ttl@secnum renamed to \ttl@write and introduced the
            \ttl@savewrite mechanism to sincronize the toc/marks
            with the title in case there is a \newpage in <after>.
1999/02/03  wrap shape
1999/02/03  Added a \kern\z@ for not to avoid hyphenation
            of the last word. Not strictly necessary, but
            it is more LaTeX-like.
1999/02/05  \partmark defined (and in \setmarks, too).
1999/02/08  \ttl@row@i simplified.
1999/02/08  \ttl@savefn mechanism.
1999/02/10  Removed extra \leavevmode in display
1999/02/13  Now \titleline doesn't add the width. It's set.
1999/02/17  The part mark is catched, even if unused.
1999/02/17  old/newparttoc added.
1999/02/18  Changed many TeX assignments to the LaTeX
            counterpart.
1999/02/19  Introduced \ttl@startargs.

History of v2.1.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1999/08/04  Moved misplaced lines in \ttl@makeboth

History of v2.2 (unreleased)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1999/11/03  We load titleps if pagestyles are required, but
            some old definitions are restored.
1999/11/06  Improved outermarks test in \ttl@sect@i. Formerly
            the section number could be printed if a page ended
            with an unnumebered section followed by a numbered one.
1999/11/06  \ttl@startargs now adds (and passes) automatically the
            section name. Involved macros modified accordingly.
1999/11/06  Replaced explicit part names by the parameter in 
            \ttl@part@i. The same for chapter.
1999/11/21  \ttl@try's are not given explicitly, but built by
            \ttl@setkeys. Intruduced the \ttl@key@... and
            \ttl@extra@... commands.
1999/11/23  Minor problems with keys fixed.
1999/12/10  Added the nobottomtitles* option and \ttl@addstretch.
2000/01/07  First steps towards the calcwidth feature (basic code). 
2000/01/08  (Continued.) \titleline* for rules of width \titlewidth.
            Option calcwidth implemented.
2000/01/12  Finished with changes in wrap.tss (no longer
            "experimental" :-) ) 

History of v2.3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2000/01/19  All keys are grouped in a single file tttkeys. Removed
            page.tsk and deleted the corresponding code in the sty.
2000/01/19  Classes begun.
2000/01/19  The level numbers are stored in \ttll@ macros, and not
            passed as arguments.
2000/01/21  Introduced the new mark scheme. It's mostly compatible
            with the old one, but a compatibility mode seems
            imposible (it was introduced in a preliminary test
            but eventually removed).
2000/01/23  loadonly package option.
2000/02/01  Classes finished. Many things had to be rewritten.
2000/02/02  Made partially compatible with hyperref (dvips).
2000/02/08  \ttl@savewrite moved from shapes to classes. But
            explicit page breaks expand it, too, to avoid wrong
            toc entries.
2000/02/18  A new box named \ttl@box stores the title in runin
            leftmargin etc shapes, to increase reliability.
            
(2.3.1 -- 2.3.3  No changes on this file)
            
History of v2.3.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        
2000/05/12  nonindentfirst redefine \titlespacing instead of
            \@afterindent... so that they don't interfere with
            the first entry in tocs.
2000/05/17  The marks in \ttl@select are protected to prevent
            endless loop if the title is expanded, say, by 
            \MakeUppercase.
     
History of v2.3.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~        
2000/05/21  Restores missing test for secnumdepth in \ttl@mkchap,
            and instead of setting \ttl@toclevel in ttlps now is
            done in \secdef. Except inside the macros, \ttl@toclevel
            is false, so that an explicit \...mark works. 
2000/06/04  \partmark defined with \providecommand
2000/06/14  A patch mechanism added, for small bug fixes.

History of v2.4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2001/01/18  Minor changes in code. Essentialy an incremental
            update.
2001/01/22  \titleformat has a new "easy" starred variant.

History of v2.5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2002/01/02  New macros for \ttl@assign. Now * length allow
            non integer values.
2002/03/22  Added \ttl@calc and \ttl@calcneg to make titlesec
            calc-savvy.
         -  Merged bug fixes of .new into this file.
         -  Bugs in frame fixed -- gap in lines, misplaced
            label, wrong margins (sometimes),
         -  \leftskip, \rightskip and \linewidth (re)set in
            margin shapes.
         -  Removed obsolete flush... options.
         -  indentafter and noindentafter, new names for
            indentfirst and nonindentfirst.
         -  A new level (\titleclass) without its "location"
            now raises a meaningful error.
         -  Bug in top-level \titleclass fixed.
2002/03/23  Tests for undefined and unformatted sectioning levels,
            and horizontal material in <format>.
         -  Missing \if@openright inside \if@twoside in
            page class added.
         -  Removed extra (but inoffensive) \expandafter
            in \ttl@class@iii.
2002/03/27  Added \titlewidthfirst and ...last
         -  "Not definable" gives a  more meaningful message in
            the context of the package.

History of v.2.6
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
2004/08/30  Corrected typo in margin \hsiz -> \hsize.
2004/10/17  Added a couple of missing \noexpand's in drop.
2004/12/01  Removed the error about the mode in block because this
            style is general purpose.
2005/01/16  Missing braces around #2 in the last else part of
            \ttl@headinline added
         -  Replaced explicit \makeatother's by a saved value as
            the macros can be used in a class/package file.
2005/01/18  newlinetospace mechanism
         -  // does not break pages; option pageatnewline to
            restore the LaTeX behaviour.
2005/01/19  \...break in top shape. 
         -  Renumbered several scratch registers to follow the
            TeXbook (p. 346), with \ttl@box in a few cases. In
            wrap \titlewidthfirst and \titlewidthlast made global.
         -  Float heads and foots have now a further argument for
            additional stuff (eg, to remove rules). Option is now
            psfloats while floatps enters in compatibility mode.
         -  \ttl@savetitle in all classes. Option toctitles.
2005/01/21  Changed pageatnewline to make it compatible with
            titletoc, with \ttl@changecentercr.
2005/01/22  \...tolist in top class.

            at the beginning of the paragraph, eg, the sec number.

2007-08-07  `explicit' improved.

History of v.2.8

2007-08-12  \titlepagestyle already used by KOMA-Script. Renamed
            to \assignpagestyle.

History of v.2.9

2011-02-25  \iftitlemeasuring test
